As we have to starta online marketing for similar products irrespective of their segments.
The problem statement ->
1. Identify the factors to predict units sold for products. - supervised
2. Identify which product will sellmore than 1000 products. - supervised
3. Create a new age bundled online marketing stratergy.     - unsupervised

Ensemble/Ensembling ->
Combining mutiple machine learning algorithms to get better accuracy, efficiency and robustness.
Types ->
1.Homogenuous ensemble models   -> Only one model is used : Techniques like bagging and boosting.
2.Heterogenuous ensemble models -> More than 1 model      : Techniques like voting, stacking, blending

Homogenuous ensemble models -> Same models -> Bagging 
Bagging -> Bootstrap + Aggregation
Bootstrap -> Create mutiple samples of the same dataset with replacament -> 
used to creates full diversity of the main dataset -> Randomness(each subset is Unique due to randomness) + variability( ensures each model captures diverse information)

Aggregation -> 
1. Classification : Mode of Predictions
2. Regression     : Mean of Predictions

How bagging battles overfitting -> many decision trees algo for each partial dataset then the average of that helps in getting a good estimate ruling out overfitting.
Best for situation like 1. High variance , 2. Low Bias
